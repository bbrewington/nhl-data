Penalties frequently cause teams to play at less than full strength, leading to situations other than 5-on-5. Also note that late-game situations with the goalie pulled do not qualify as 5-on-5, e.g. turning 5-on-5 into 6-on-5 when a skater replaces the goalie on the ice. Many enhanced stats concentrate on 5-on-5 play to compare players under the manpower-neutral circumstances that make up the majority of time in a game.",

The last teammate to touch the puck before the goal scorer is awarded a primary assist. The preceding teammate to touch the puck before the first assisting player is awarded a secondary assist.

Only 5-on-5 shot attempts are currently counted. The reason for looking at SAT (or alternatively, USAT, which excludes blocked shots) instead of plus-minus is to take advantage of the much larger sample size of shot attempts than goals, and to remove the influence of varying goaltending performance from a measure of skater performance. SAT can be represented by a differential, like plus-minus, where a positive number is above average (which is how SAT is displayed on nhl.com), or as a percentage, where over 50% is above average (shown by SAT% on nhl.com). Though SAT is a common proxy for puck possession, it does not measure actual puck possession time. SAT (and USAT) are also calculated when the player's team is ahead or behind in the score, or tied, or when the score is close. SAT is available since 2009-10.

While he is on the ice, a player receives a plus for any unblocked shot attempt (on goal or missed) that his team directs toward the opponents goal, and a minus for any unblocked shot attempt (on goal or missed) toward his own goal. Only 5-on-5 shot attempts are currently counted. The reason for looking at USAT (or alternatively, SAT, which includes blocked shots) instead of plus-minus is to take advantage of the much larger sample size of unblocked shot attempts than goals, and to remove the influence of varying goaltending performance from a measure of skater performance. With the removal of blocked shot attempts from consideration, the sample size of USAT is slightly smaller than that of SAT; however, USAT takes team and player shot blocking performance into account, while SAT does not. USAT can be represented by a differential, like plus-minus, where a positive number is above average (which is how USAT is displayed on nhl.com), or as a percentage, where over 50% is above average (shown by USAT% on nhl.com). Though USAT is a common proxy for puck possession, it does not measure actual puck possession time. USAT (and SAT) are also calculated when the player's team is ahead or behind in the score, or tied, or when the score is close. USAT is available since 2009-10.
